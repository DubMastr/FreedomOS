* I wanted to take this moment and this file to express my love and appreciation to every single one of you. The ARISEâ„¢ project and community has easily been the most fulfilling in my life. 

* Unfortunately, it has also provided the most devastation in my life at times. Most recently, April 28, beginning with the ruin of my Nexus 6 device and ending with the ultimate case of being "catfished".

* This build will be my last, as May 1, 2017 will be the beginning of my "retirement". I hope you all can understand, or at least, will understand soon. I simply need to pick up all these pieces after my world falling apart just two days ago.

* Lastly, always find the good in humanity and never let one individual's malice and deceit risk ever changing that.

* "When in doubt... always trust your first instinct." -gh

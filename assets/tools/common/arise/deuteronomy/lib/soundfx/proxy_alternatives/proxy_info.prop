/system/lib/soundfx/libeffectproxy.so will be an abstraction of the SW and HW effects, which is not always natively compatible with ViPER4Android on a given device resulting in no ViPER4Android processing being the only issue.


The stock libeffectproxy.so on a device is, often times, updated with each firmware image, meaning that an incompatible libeffectproxy.so is likely temporary.


This inactive folder is provided for times the stock libeffectproxy.so on the device is incapacitating ViPER4Android's processing function.


To experiment with an alternative libeffectproxy.so provided in this directory, copy the desired /proxy_alternatives/lib/soundfx/libeffectproxy_*.so and paste into /system/lib/soundfx on the device. The alternative libraries are named uniquely to describe its source.


Rename or move the original /system/lib/soundfx/libeffectproxy.so to the /stock folder in this directory for convenient access to the stock libeffectproxy.so. At this time, the alternative libeffectproxy.so can be named appropriately resulting in /system/lib/soundfx/libeffectproxy.so.


Be aware that not every alternative proxy has a 64 bit version of the proxy. A 64 bit device can certainly use a selected proxy without its 64 bit library if not available.


Before rebooting the device to finish the procedure, ensure that 0644 permissions are set for the new proxy and ensure correct spelling.


This only provides a fix for a very specific scenario so it will not cure all issues/bugs experienced with ViPER4Android. If libeffectproxy.so is not the cause for an issue, provide a detailed report on our thread and  we'll get you sorted in no time. :good:
